## üîß Issues Fixed in This Review

### 1. ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md - Unreleased Section
**Issue:** CHANGELOG had `[Unreleased]` section but package.json showed 1.2.0  
**Fix Applied:** Converted to `[1.2.0] - 2025-10-14` dated release entry  
**Status:** FIXED

### 2. ‚úÖ Documentation Act Count Inconsistency
**Issue:** Package README.md referenced "9 Acts" instead of "11 Acts"  
**Fix Applied:** Updated to "11 Acts" with complete list including Act 10 (Unused Parameters) and Act 11 (Empty Interfaces)  
**Status:** FIXED

### 3. ‚úÖ Missing Documentation References
**Issue:** docs/README.md referenced non-existent `api.md` and `troubleshooting.md`  
**Fix Applied:** Removed references to missing files  
**Status:** FIXED

## üì¶ What's New in v1.2.0

### Added
- **Unity-safe Python validator** (`story_test_unity_safe.py`) for standalone validation without Unity dependencies
- **Reality anchor system** (`REALITY_CHECK.md`) for accurate project status tracking
- **False positive filtering** for compiler-generated artifacts (Roslyn, Unity lifecycle methods)
- **Anti-false-celebration documentation** practices for AI assistants

### Fixed
- Python validator Unity dependency crashes (`UnityEngine.CoreModule` loading failures)
- 30 false positives from enum interface methods and delegate artifacts
- Configuration path issues in `StoryTestSettings.json`
- Documentation drift (9 Acts vs actual 11 Acts)

### Improved
- CI/CD pipeline with Linux-first canonical builds
- Cross-platform Python validation without Unity installation requirements
- Assembly loading with graceful fallback for Unity-dependent assemblies
