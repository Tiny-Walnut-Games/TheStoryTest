## [Unreleased]


## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- Stable Acts 1-11 validation pipeline (proven, tested, production-ready)
- Enhanced compiler-generated member detection
- Improved false positive filtering
- **Acts 12-13 Full Implementation**: Assembly-level validation infrastructure
  - Act 12 (Mental Model Claims) - Validates claimed capabilities have evidence
  - Act 13 (Narrative Coherence) - Validates architecture alignment with narrative
  - Assembly-level validation orchestration in StoryIntegrityValidator
  - Configuration-driven validation with storytest-mental-model.json
  - Python validator integration with Acts 12-13 support
  - Multi-output reporting (JSON, HTML, exit codes)

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- CI/CD workflow Unity version mismatch (updated from 2022.3.17f1 to 6000.0.30f1 to match project version)
- False positive violation for `IEnumerator.Reset()` in compiler-generated iterator state machines
- Enhanced compiler-generated member detection in both C# and Python validators to skip explicit interface implementations in state machines
- Python validation script (`story_test.py`) now properly filters compiler-generated iterator/async state machine members

### Changed
- Improved release script to update all three version files atomically (Unity package.json, root package.json, pyproject.toml)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- Unity-safe Python validator (`story_test_unity_safe.py`) for standalone validation
- Reality anchor system (`REALITY_CHECK.md`) for accurate project status tracking
- False positive filtering for compiler-generated artifacts (Roslyn, Unity lifecycle)
- Anti-false-celebration documentation practices for AI assistants

### Fixed
- Python validator Unity dependency crashes (`UnityEngine.CoreModule` loading failures)
- 30 false positives from enum interface methods and delegate artifacts
- Configuration path issues in `StoryTestSettings.json`
- Documentation drift (9 Acts vs actual 11 Acts)

### Improved
- CI/CD pipeline with Linux-first canonical builds
- Cross-platform Python validation without Unity installation requirements
- Assembly loading with graceful fallback for Unity-dependent assemblies

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- Complete GitHub Actions workflow with Linux canonical builds
- Unity Playmode test integration with sync-point performance testing
- Python CoreCLR runtime support for better cross-platform compatibility
- Automated assembly discovery and validation

### Fixed
- Platform identifier errors (Linux64 â†’ StandaloneLinux64)
- Action version deprecation warnings (migrated to @v4/@v5 tags)
- Unity assembly loading in standalone Python validator
- Linter configuration for GitHub Actions validation

### Changed
- Migrated from commit SHAs to major version tags for GitHub Actions
- Implemented cost-optimized CI/CD (Linux-first, manual Windows/macOS)
- Enhanced error handling for Unity dependency resolution

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- Initial release of Story Test Framework
- 11 validation Acts for IL bytecode analysis
- Unity Editor integration with menu system
- ProductionExcellenceStoryTest MonoBehaviour
- StoryIntegrityValidator with automatic rule discovery
- Python standalone validator with .NET reflection
- Comprehensive test suite with NUnit integration

### Features
- **Act 1**: Todo Comments (NotImplementedException detection)
- **Act 2**: Placeholder Implementations (minimal IL detection)
- **Act 3**: Incomplete Classes (abstract method implementation)
- **Act 4**: Unsealed Abstract Members (abstract method sealing)
- **Act 5**: Debug Only Implementations ([Obsolete] requirement)
- **Act 6**: Phantom Props (unused auto-properties)
- **Act 7**: Cold Methods (empty/minimal methods)
- **Act 8**: Hollow Enums (minimal enum values)
- **Act 9**: Premature Celebrations (complete but throwing)
- **Act 10**: Suspiciously Simple Methods (constant returns)
- **Act 11**: Dead Code (unused fields/properties/methods)

### Architecture
- Multi-assembly structure with clear separation of concerns
- Unity-agnostic core validation logic
- Conditional compilation for cross-platform compatibility
- StoryIgnoreAttribute for intentional exclusions
- Dynamic rule registration via reflection
