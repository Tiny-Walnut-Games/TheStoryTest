## **Symbol Integrity & Narrative Completeness for C# Projects**

A code quality validation framework that enforces the "Story Test Doctrine": every symbol (method, property, parameter, enum) must be fully implemented and meaningful—no placeholders, TODOs, or unused code in production.

Originally designed for Unity ECS/DOTS projects, Story Test is now **Unity-agnostic** and works with any C# codebase, including GameObject-based Unity projects and pure .NET applications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
Add to Unity Package Manager via git URL:
```
https://github.com/jmeyer1980/TheStoryTest.git?path=Packages/com.tinywalnutgames.storytest
```

### First Validation
```bash
# Python validator (no Unity required)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/story_test_unity_safe.py . --verbose

# Unity Editor
Tiny Walnut Games > The Story Test > Run Story Test and Export Report
```

## 📚 Documentation

## ✨ Features

- **11 Validation Acts** - IL bytecode analysis for code quality
- **Cross-Platform** - Unity Editor + standalone Python validator
- **CI/CD Ready** - GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI integration
- **Zero Dependencies** - Works without Unity installation
- **Production Proven** - Asset Store published developer

## 🎯 Core Validation

- **Act 1**: Todo Comments (`NotImplementedException`)
- **Act 2**: Placeholder Implementations (minimal IL)
- **Act 3**: Incomplete Classes (abstract methods)
- **Act 4**: Unsealed Abstract Members
- **Act 5**: Debug Only Implementations (`[Obsolete]`)
- **Act 6**: Phantom Props (unused properties)
- **Act 7**: Cold Methods (empty methods)
- **Act 8**: Hollow Enums (minimal values)
- **Act 9**: Premature Celebrations (complete but throwing)
- **Act 10**: Suspiciously Simple Methods (constant returns)
- **Act 11**: Dead Code (unused members)

**Remember**: Every symbol in your assembly should read like a finished chapter. If a parameter, method, or enum feels like foreshadowing, seal it with intent or finish the scene before shipping.
