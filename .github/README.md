## **Symbol Integrity & Narrative Completeness for C# Projects**

A code quality validation framework that enforces the "Story Test Doctrine": every symbol (method, property, parameter, enum) must be fully implemented and meaningful‚Äîno placeholders, TODOs, or unused code in production.

Originally designed for Unity ECS/DOTS projects, Story Test is now **Unity-agnostic** and works with any C# codebase, including GameObject-based Unity projects and pure .NET applications.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
Download and extract the zip/tar.gz and extract it into your packages or assets folder. I recommend asking your agent to validate your project by setting up The Story Test and its settings.json to match your project's needs. As long as the agent has tool access, it will be able to install all prerequisites and validate your project for you.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
Add to Unity Package Manager via git URL:
```
https://github.com/jmeyer1980/TheStoryTest.git?path=Packages/com.tinywalnutgames.storytest
```

### First Validation
```bash
# Python validator (no Unity required)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/story_test_unity_safe.py . --verbose

# Unity Editor
Tiny Walnut Games > The Story Test > Run Story Test and Export Report
```

## üéØ Core Validation

- **Act 1**: Todo Comments (`NotImplementedException`)
- **Act 2**: Placeholder Implementations (minimal IL)
- **Act 3**: Incomplete Classes (abstract methods)
- **Act 4**: Unsealed Abstract Members
- **Act 5**: Debug Only Implementations (`[Obsolete]`)
- **Act 6**: Phantom Props (unused properties)
- **Act 7**: Cold Methods (empty methods)
- **Act 8**: Hollow Enums (minimal values)
- **Act 9**: Premature Celebrations (complete but throwing)
- **Act 10**: Suspiciously Simple Methods (constant returns)
- **Act 11**: Dead Code (unused members)

**Remember**: Every symbol in your assembly should read like a finished chapter. If a parameter, method, or enum feels like foreshadowing, seal it with intent or finish the scene before shipping.
