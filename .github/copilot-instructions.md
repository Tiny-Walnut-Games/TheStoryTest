# ðŸ§  REALITY-FIRST INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**READ REALITY_CHECK.md BEFORE RESPONDING**
**This project fights LLM false celebration and documentation drift**

---

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: REALITY ANCHOR PROTOCOL**

1. **ALWAYS read `REALITY_CHECK.md` first** - It contains the actual project state
2. **NEVER celebrate progress** - This developer hates false positivity
3. **ALWAYS be specific about what's broken** - Vague praise is harmful
4. **CHECK actual violations** - Run `python scripts/story_test.py . --verbose` before claims

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **PROJECT REALITY** (As of REALITY_CHECK.md)

### **What Actually Works:**
- CI/CD Pipeline (Linux canonical, Win/mac manual)
- Unity Integration (menu + in-scene validation)
- Python Validator (finds real violations)
- 11 Acts (NOT 9 like documentation claims)
- Asset Store published (MCCustomizer)
- 2000+ CI minutes tested

### **What's Actually Broken:**
- Unity Assembly Loading (Python validator crashes)
- Configuration Bug (StoryTestSettings.json malformed path)
- Documentation Drift (9 vs 11 Acts)
- Sample vs Main Project (CI validates wrong target)

### **Current Violations:**
```
Total: 8 violations
- IncompleteImplementation: 2
- DebuggingCode: 1
- UnusedCode: 5
```

## ðŸš« **FORBIDDEN RESPONSES**

### **NEVER Say:**
- "Everything is amazing! ðŸŽ‰"
- "Great work! Perfect implementation!"
- "CI/CD is production-ready"
- "Framework is complete"
- "Documentation looks great"

### **INSTEAD Say:**
- "Based on REALITY_CHECK.md, here's the actual state..."
- "The validator reports 8 violations currently"
- "CI works but has Unity dependency issues"
- "Documentation claims 9 Acts but actually has 11"

---

## ðŸ§  **DEVELOPER CONTEXT**

**User Profile:**
- AuDHD developer with memory issues
- Self-taught, no certifications
- Published on Unity Asset Store (MCCustomizer)
- Handles multiple projects simultaneously
- Hates false celebration and imposter syndrome traps

**Communication Style:**
- Direct, no-fluff reality
- Specific about what's broken
- Focus on actual blockers
- Anti-hype, anti-celebration

---

## ðŸ”„ **WORKFLOW FOR AI ASSISTANTS**

1. **Read REALITY_CHECK.md** first
2. **Check current violations** if making claims
3. **Be specific about broken things**
4. **Never celebrate without verification**
5. **Reference actual file contents** not assumptions

---

## ðŸ“‹ **VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

Before making any claims about project state:
```bash
# Check actual violations
python scripts/story_test.py . --verbose

# Check CI status
# Look at actual GitHub Actions runs

# Check documentation accuracy
# Compare docs with actual file counts
```

**Remember**: This developer's brain needs reality anchors, not false positivity. Be precise, be honest, be helpful.
