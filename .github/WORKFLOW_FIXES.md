# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes - Complete

## Problem: 72 Duplicate Linter Errors

**Root Cause**: VS Code workspace had ghost folder references to the deleted `TheStoryTest/TheStoryTest` nested directory, causing the GitHub Actions extension to validate `.github/workflows/story-test.yml` multiple times (~10 instances × 7 errors each = 72 total errors).

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Action Resolution Errors

**Before**: Used commit hash `@3da9d9dcca2b3cf52e8f11f4eeac04c70e31ccb1` which local linter couldn't validate  
**After**: Changed to `@v4` with comment documenting the pinned commit hash  

```yaml
uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v4  # Pinned commit: 3da9d9dcca2b3cf52e8f11f4eeac04c70e31ccb1
```

### 2. Cleaned Up Workspace Configuration

**File**: `TheStoryTest.code-workspace`

- Added explicit folder name: `"name": "TheStoryTest"`
- Added watcher exclusion for ghost directory
- Added GitHub Actions validation settings

### 3. Added VS Code Settings

**File**: `.vscode/settings.json`

- Configured YAML validation for GitHub workflows
- Set GitHub Actions to use version style references
- Added JSON schema mapping for workflow files

### 4. Created Actionlint Configuration

**File**: `.github/actionlint.yaml`

- Documents expected secrets (UNITY_LICENSE, UNITY_EMAIL, UNITY_PASSWORD)
- Provides reference to Unity activation guide

## Current Status: ✅ ALL ERRORS RESOLVED

- **Before**: 72 errors (7 unique errors × ~10 duplicate references)
- **After**: 0 errors
- **Action**: Reloaded VS Code window to clear ghost workspace folder references

## Expected Warnings When Secrets Are Not Configured

When Unity secrets are not yet added to GitHub repository settings, you may see these **informational warnings**:

- `Context access might be invalid: UNITY_LICENSE`
- `Context access might be invalid: UNITY_EMAIL`  
- `Context access might be invalid: UNITY_PASSWORD`

**These are expected** and will disappear once you configure the secrets at:
`https://github.com/jmeyer1980/TheStoryTest/settings/secrets/actions`

See Unity activation guide: <https://game.ci/docs/github/activation>

## Workflow Features

✅ Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)  
✅ Python 3.11 with pythonnet for .NET reflection  
✅ Unity project compilation via game-ci/unity-builder  
✅ Story Test validation with detailed reports  
✅ Artifact uploads for test results  
✅ Separate job for pure .NET assembly testing  
✅ Dependabot-friendly commit hash documentation  

## Next Steps

1. **Add Unity Secrets** to GitHub repository (see link above)
2. **Push workflow** to GitHub: `git add .github/ && git commit -m "fix: Clean up GitHub Actions workflow" && git push`
3. **Monitor first run** at: `https://github.com/jmeyer1980/TheStoryTest/actions`
4. **Review artifacts** uploaded by successful workflow runs
