# Automation Summary

## What We Added

### 1. Release Automation Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/release-automation.yml`

**What it does**:
- Automatically creates GitHub releases when version tags are pushed
- Generates release notes from git commit history
- Updates CHANGELOG.md automatically
- Validates code before release

**Triggers**:
- Push of version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Manual workflow dispatch (with dry-run option)

### 2. Release Helper Script
**File**: `scripts/release.sh`

**What it does**:
- Bumps version numbers (major/minor/patch)
- Updates `package.json` automatically
- Creates git tags
- Provides dry-run mode for testing

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh bump patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
./scripts/release.sh push        # Trigger release
```

### 3. Release Process Documentation
**File**: `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`

Complete guide for maintainers on how to create releases.

## What Can Be Removed

### Manual Artifacts (Safe to Delete)
These files were created for manual documentation but are now automated:

1. **`REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`** - Refactoring details
   - **Why remove**: Git commits + PR descriptions serve this purpose
   - **Alternative**: Use conventional commits for better changelog
   
2. **Manual CHANGELOG entries** - Partially automated
   - **Keep**: `CHANGELOG.md` file itself
   - **Change**: Let workflow update it automatically
   - **Manual work**: Only update [Unreleased] section between releases

## Workflow Comparison: TLDA vs TheStoryTest

### What We Borrowed from TLDA

| TLDA Feature | TheStoryTest Implementation | Status |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------|
| Chronicle Keeper (auto-TLDL) | Not implemented | Future consideration |
| Docs Validation | Exists in `story-test.yml` | âœ… Already have |
| Release Automation | `release-automation.yml` | âœ… Implemented |
| Version Bumping | `release.sh` script | âœ… Implemented |

### What We Didn't Implement (Yet)

1. **Chronicle Keeper** - Auto-generates TLDL from issues/PRs
   - **Why skip**: TheStoryTest is simpler, doesn't need TLDL system
   - **Alternative**: Use GitHub Releases + conventional commits
   
2. **Docs Health Scoring** - Metrics for documentation quality
   - **Why skip**: Story Test validation IS the health score
   - **Alternative**: CI badge shows validation status

3. **Daily Ledger** - Scheduled documentation generation
   - **Why skip**: Not needed for a framework project
   - **Alternative**: Release notes capture development narrative

## Benefits of This Approach

### Reduced Cognitive Load
- âœ… No manual CHANGELOG updates
- âœ… No manual version bumping
- âœ… No manual release note writing
- âœ… One command to release: `./scripts/release.sh bump patch && ./scripts/release.sh push`

### Better Narrative
- âœ… Git history becomes the changelog
- âœ… Conventional commits create structure
- âœ… Releases tell the story automatically
- âœ… CI validates before release

### Maintainability
- âœ… Less documentation drift
- âœ… Single source of truth (git)
- âœ… Automated validation gates
- âœ… Dry-run testing capability

## Next Steps (Optional)

### If You Want More Automation

1. **Add Conventional Commit Linting**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/commit-lint.yml
   - uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5
   ```

2. **Auto-generate Changelog from Commits**
   ```bash
   npm install -g conventional-changelog-cli
   conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s
   ```

3. **Add Release Badges**
   ```markdown
   ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Tiny-Walnut-Games/TheStoryTest)
   ```

### If You Want Less Automation

Keep it simple:
- Manual version bumps
- Manual CHANGELOG updates
- Just use the workflow for validation

## Philosophy

This automation embodies Story Test principles:

> **"Every line of code tells a story. Let automation write the boring parts."**

- **Validation First**: No release without passing tests
- **Narrative Continuity**: Git history IS the documentation
- **Reduce Friction**: One command to release
- **Preserve Context**: Automated release notes capture the journey

## Comparison to Manual Process

### Before (Manual)
1. Update `package.json` version
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` manually
3. Write `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`
4. Commit changes
5. Create git tag
6. Push to GitHub
7. Create GitHub release manually
8. Write release notes manually

**Time**: ~30 minutes per release

### After (Automated)
1. `./scripts/release.sh bump patch`
2. `./scripts/release.sh push`

**Time**: ~2 minutes per release

**Savings**: 28 minutes + reduced mental overhead
