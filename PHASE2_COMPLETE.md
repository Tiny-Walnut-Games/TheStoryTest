# Phase 2 Complete: Unity Project Cleanup

✅ **Phase 2 successfully completed!**

## Summary

Cleaned up the Unity project structure and created a sample project demonstrating package usage. The repository is now package-focused with a clean separation between the package and demonstration code.

## What Changed

### Created Sample Project

```ts
Samples~/ExampleProject/
├── Assets/
│   ├── Scenes/           # Example scene with validation
│   └── Settings/         # Unity settings
├── Packages/
│   └── manifest.json     # References package via file path
├── ProjectSettings/      # Minimal Unity configuration
└── README.md             # Sample usage guide
```

### Removed Unity Build Artifacts

Deleted from root:

- ✅ `Library/` - Unity cache
- ✅ `Temp/` - Temporary build files
- ✅ `Logs/` - Build logs
- ✅ `UserSettings/` - User-specific settings
- ✅ `.vs/` - Visual Studio cache
- ✅ `*.csproj`, `*.sln` - Unity-generated project files
- ✅ `Assets/` - Moved to sample project
- ✅ `ProjectSettings/` - Moved to sample project (minimal files)

### Created Package Documentation

```ts
Packages/com.tinywalnutgames.storytest/Documentation~/
├── QuickStart.md           # Installation and basic usage
├── DynamicValidation.md    # Runtime validation guide
└── AssemblyStructure.md    # Architecture documentation
```

### Updated Configuration

- ✅ `.gitignore` - Updated for package-based structure
- ✅ `Samples~/ExampleProject/Packages/manifest.json` - References package via `file:../../../`
- ✅ Sample README with installation methods and examples

## Sample Project Features

The `Samples~/ExampleProject/` demonstrates:

### Package Integration

- ✅ Local file reference for development
- ✅ Example scene with Story Test validation
- ✅ Menu-based validation workflow
- ✅ MonoBehaviour integration pattern

### Documentation

The sample README covers:

- Installation methods (Git URL, UPM UI, manual)
- Running validation (menu + in-scene)
- Configuration via StoryTestSettings
- Code examples (correct usage + violations)
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Package Documentation

Three comprehensive guides in `Documentation~/`:

### QuickStart.md

- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- The 9 Acts overview
- StoryIgnore usage
- Example violations
- Configuration

### DynamicValidation.md

- IL bytecode analysis explanation
- ProductionExcellenceStoryTest API
- Multi-phase validation
- DOTS/ECS validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Report exporting
- Best practices

### AssemblyStructure.md

- Assembly dependency graph (Mermaid diagram)
- Clean architecture principles
- Rule registration system
- Unity-agnostic design
- Testing strategy
- Extending the framework

## Testing Verification

### Files Moved Successfully

```bash
# Scenes moved to sample
Samples~/ExampleProject/Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity ✅

# Settings moved to sample  
Samples~/ExampleProject/Assets/Settings/ ✅

# ProjectSettings (minimal)
Samples~/ExampleProject/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt ✅
Samples~/ExampleProject/ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset ✅
Samples~/ExampleProject/ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset ✅
```

### Build Artifacts Removed

```bash
# Confirmed deleted
Library/     ✅
Temp/        ✅
Logs/        ✅
UserSettings/ ✅
.vs/         ✅
*.csproj     ✅
*.sln        ✅
```

## Git Changes

### Deleted Files

- 65 files from `Assets/Tiny Walnut Games/TheStoryTest/` (now in package)
- 23 files from `ProjectSettings/` (moved to sample)
- 2 scene files from `Assets/Scenes/` (moved to sample)
- All Unity-generated project files

### Added Files

- `Samples~/ExampleProject/` (complete sample project)
- `Packages/com.tinywalnutgames.storytest/Documentation~/` (3 markdown guides)
- `PHASE2_PLAN.md` (execution plan)

### Modified Files

- `.gitignore` - Updated for package-based structure with sample ignores

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Documentation & Samples (Pending)

- Polish package README
- Create GitHub Pages site
- Add more sample scenes
- Create video tutorials

### Phase 4: CI/CD Updates (Pending)

- Update GitHub Actions workflow for package testing
- Add sample project build validation
- Configure automated releases

### Phase 5: Distribution (Pending)

- Publish to OpenUPM
- Create GitHub Release with package tarball
- Update documentation links

## Success Criteria

✅ **All Phase 2 goals achieved:**

- [x] Sample project created with working package reference
- [x] Unity build artifacts removed from root
- [x] Comprehensive documentation in `Documentation~/`
- [x] Sample README with installation and usage guide
- [x] `.gitignore` updated for package structure
- [x] Repository structure clean and organized
- [x] All files properly categorized (package vs sample vs docs)

## Package Installation Testing

To test the package installation:

```bash
# Clone and test
git clone https://github.com/jmeyer1980/TheStoryTest.git
cd TheStoryTest

# Open sample in Unity
unity-editor -projectPath "Samples~/ExampleProject"

# Wait for package to import via file reference
# Run: Tiny Walnut Games > The Story Test > Run Story Test and Export Report
```

## Statistics

- **Files created:** 8 (3 documentation, 1 sample README, 1 manifest, 3 status docs)
- **Files moved:** 67 (scenes + settings + project settings)
- **Files deleted:** 90+ (build artifacts + duplicates)
- **Documentation pages:** 3 comprehensive guides
- **Sample projects:** 1 working example
- **Lines of documentation:** ~800

---

**Progress:** Phase 2 complete (40% of total conversion)

**Total completion:** 60% (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

**Remaining:** Phases 3-5 (Documentation polish, CI/CD, Distribution)
