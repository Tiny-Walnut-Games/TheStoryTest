# README Badge Sync Instructions

## Current Status âœ…

All branches now have proper badges:

- **main**: 11 Acts (stable release)
- **develop**: 11 Acts + "Coming Soon 13 Acts" badge
- **pre-release**: 13 Acts + "1.3.0 Pre-release" badge

## How to Update Badges in Future

### Option 1: Manual Update (Recommended)
1. Make your README changes on the current branch
2. For each branch that needs updating:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   # Update badges manually in README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update badges for <branch-name>"
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Option 2: Use the sync scripts
- `sync_readme.py` - Full Python script (may have encoding issues)
- `quick_sync_readme.py` - Simpler Python script
- `sync-readme.ps1` - PowerShell script (needs fixing)
