I am self taught. And my entire development team is filled with Agentic LLMs and RAGs. This means that no matter how hard I try... I miss shit and having inaccurate representation of the current reality of the project is derailing.">

But I felt it was necessary because rapid rebuilding seemed to be the only path towards ensuring all three build. But, in hindsite, had I realized that linux was just so much faster, I would have started with the canonical build target from the get-go.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind here, that I only really started vibe coding in June of this year.

All developmental history artifacts need to find a home within a changelog and I believe we may need to implement the versioning scheme and prep the packages for release.

I find them to be bloat rather then useful. There are some circumstances where such a thing is needed, like tools packaged with other tools... but that's about it.

        <entry key="yes because every time I try I get this fucked up white background when it is already transparent. Also... I can only add the file to the readme when I paste it in from outside of the browser and that is annoying as hell. I right click the editor and no contextual menu shows up... so many QOL things Rider is missing... and they make you pay a sub for commercial rights to your own code. I hate this IDE but I use it anyway.">
