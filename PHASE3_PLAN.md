# Phase 3: Documentation & Polish ‚Äî Execution Plan

**Issue:** #3  
**Branch:** `jmeyer1980/phase3-docs` *(proposed)*  
**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** üöÄ Kickoff

## Overview

CI is now green across Windows, macOS, and Linux (workflow run #37), so we can focus on storytelling-quality documentation, developer ergonomics, and polish. Phase 3 turns the framework's philosophy into actionable guidance and makes the UPM package feel production-ready out of the box.

## Objectives

1. **Document Protective Mechanisms** ‚Äî Explain `[StoryIgnore]` usage, the üè≥ educational comment shield, and how to justify exemptions without hiding real debt.
2. **Surface CI Insights** ‚Äî Record how the Python validator reports file/line data, note GameCI Editor-test limitations, capture Linux-as-canonical workflow guidance, and provide troubleshooting tips.
3. **Consolidate Learning Materials** ‚Äî Organize tutorials, samples, and Act explanations into `Documentation~/` for UPM consumption while keeping README concise.
4. **Polish the Narrative** ‚Äî Ensure every section reinforces "symbol integrity" with real examples, diagrams, or mini walkthroughs.

## Current State vs Target State

| Area | Current | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| README | Installation + overview with minimal CI nuance | Story-driven overview with links to deep dives, highlights protective patterns, references Phase 3 plan |
| Documentation~/ | Not created yet | Contains QuickStart, Act guide, troubleshooting (UPM-friendly) |
| Samples~/ExampleProject docs | Skeleton plan in Phase 2 | Step-by-step tutorial + Story Test report walkthrough |
| CHANGELOG | Contains prior notes | Updated with doc improvements and CI milestone |

## Phase 3 Tasks

### Task 1: Stabilize README & high-level messaging ‚úÖ

- [x] Add `[StoryIgnore]` infrastructure guidance
- [x] Document üè≥ educational comment shield
- [x] Capture CI file/line reporting + run #37 success
- [x] Note GameCI Editor-test limitations

### Task 2: Create `Documentation~/` bundle üöß

- [ ] Draft `Documentation~/QuickStart.md` tailored to package consumers
- [ ] Author `Documentation~/ActsGuide.md` with examples per Act
- [ ] Add `Documentation~/CI.md` covering validator usage, known limitations, troubleshooting
- [ ] Wire UPM documentation links in `package.json`

### Task 3: Refresh samples documentation üöß

- [ ] Flesh out `Samples~/ExampleProject/README.md` with validation walkthrough
- [ ] Provide screenshot or summary of a clean Story Test report
- [ ] Add instructions for running validator against the sample via CLI

### Task 4: CHANGELOG & release notes prep üöß

- [ ] Insert Phase 3 doc updates entry
- [ ] Highlight CI improvements (file/line reporting, inherited method fix)

### Task 5: Stretch Goals üéØ

- [ ] Produce short Loom/demo script highlighting Acts in action
- [ ] Add FAQ section answering common Story Test integration questions

## Milestones

1. ‚úÖ **Milestone A:** README refreshed with protective patterns and CI notes (completed in repo commit TBD).
2. ‚è≥ **Milestone B:** Documentation~/ bundle published and referenced in package manifest.
3. ‚è≥ **Milestone C:** Sample project docs guide newcomers from installation to first clean run.
4. ‚è≥ **Milestone D:** CHANGELOG + release notes ready for v3.0.0 documentation release.

## Dependencies & Risks

- **Dependency:** Phase 2 cleanup tasks should remain stable (no asset moves mid-doc rewrite).
- **Risk:** GameCI Editor-mode support status may change; monitor upstream and note updates.
- **Mitigation:** Keep troubleshooting guidance versioned and link to upstream issues when available.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `npm pack` / UPM inspection shows Documentation~/ content shipping correctly
- [ ] README quick start matches sample project instructions
- [ ] Python validator usage matches documented commands and outputs
- [ ] CI still green after docs-only PR (build matrix untouched)

## Exit Criteria ‚Üí Phase 4 Handoff

- ‚úÖ Documentation tasks above completed and merged through `jmeyer1980/issue2`
- ‚úÖ Branch rebased/merged so `main` reflects Phase 3 deliverables before starting Phase 4
- ‚úÖ Stage 4 prerequisites captured: package validation in a clean Unity project and external repo workflow rehearsal (see `PHASE4_PLAN.md`)
- ‚úÖ Any open doc issues triaged so CI/CD updates can proceed without documentation blockers

*Phase 3 is about telling the Story Test story as clearly as we enforce it‚Äîevery symbol, every doc section, every example should reinforce narrative completeness.*
