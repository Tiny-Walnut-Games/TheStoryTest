Now I can compare the two:\n\nGameManager.GetBubblePosition (lines 119-134):\n```csharp\nvar offsetX = (y % 2 == 1) ? bubbleRadius : 0f;\nvar xPos = x * bubbleRadius * 2f + offsetX - (gridWidth * bubbleRadius);\n\nvar yPos = gameSetup != null \n    ? gameSetup.gridTopY - (y * bubbleRadius * 1.732f)\n    : y * bubbleRadius * 1.732f;\n\nyPos += gridOffsetY;\n```\n\nBubble.GetGridPosition (lines 651-669 from earlier):\n```csharp\nvar offsetX = (y % 2 == 1) ? gameManager.GetBubbleRadius() : 0f;\nvar xPos = x * gameManager.GetBubbleRadius() * 2f + offsetX - (11 * gameManager.GetBubbleRadius());\n\nvar yPos = gameSetup != null \n    ? gameSetup.gridTopY - (y * gameManager.GetBubbleRadius() * 1.732f)\n    : y * gameManager.GetBubbleRadius() * 1.732f;\n\nyPos += gameManager.GetGridOffsetY();\n```\n\nThese look very similar! The main difference is:\n- GameManager uses `(gridWidth * bubbleRadius)`\n- Bubble.cs uses `(11 * gameManager.GetBubbleRadius())`\n\nAnd gridWidth is probably 11, and GetBubbleRadius() is probably bubbleRadius, so they should be equivalent.\n\nBut the hex grid neighbor calculation might be wrong. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nActually, wait. Let me look more carefully at the hex grid neighbor logic. The contact is at (2, 9), which is an odd row. \n\nFor an odd row, the neighbors should be:\n- Upper-left: (1, 8)\n\n\n- Upper-right: (2, 8) \n- Left: (1, 9)\n- Right: (3, 9)\n- Lower-left: (1, 10)\n- Lower-right: (2, 10)\n\nI'm investigating potential issues with the hex grid geometry and neighbor calculations. The current neighbor placement seems off, with the code identifying (1, 10) as the best match at distance 4.29, which contradicts the expected neighbor positions. This suggests fundamental problems in either the neighbor detection algorithm, distance calculation method, or coordinate transformation process for the hexagonal grid layout.\n\nThe vertical hex grid geometry requires precise coordinate offsets and neighbor mapping, especially for odd and even rows. My focus is on understanding why the current implementation produces unexpected results that deviate from standard hex grid neighbor relationships. I'm carefully analyzing the hex grid's offset mechanics, focusing on how row parity affects neighbor calculations. The current implementation seems to have inconsistent neighbor selection logic for odd and even rows. \n\nThe key observation is that when rows are offset differently, the neighbor coordinate calculations must account for this horizontal shift. Specifically, the upper-left and upper-right neighbor coordinates change based on whether the current row is odd or even.\n\nI need to trace how the world position and grid coordinate transformations interact, particularly examining how the bubbleRadius impacts horizontal positioning across different row parities. The current implementation appears to have a subtle asymmetry in neighbor selection that could lead to incorrect spatial relationships. I'm exploring the hex grid neighbor calculation, focusing on how even and odd rows connect. The current implementation seems incorrect for determining upper neighbors of an even row cell. \n\nThe coordinate system reveals y increases downward, with row 0 at the top. This means when calculating neighbors for a cell like (2, 8), the expected upper neighbors should actually be (1, 7) and (2, 7), not the current code's output of (2, 7) and (3, 7).\n\nThe key observation is the half-cell horizontal offset between even and odd rows, which impacts how neighbors are determined. This offset requires precise tracking to ensure accurate neighbor selection across the hex grid. A bubble at (2, 8) reveals a discrepancy in neighbor calculation for even rows. The current code incorrectly identifies upper neighbors as (2, 7) and (3, 7), when they should actually be (1, 7) and (2, 7). This indicates a systematic error in how upper neighbors are determined for even-numbered rows in the grid system.\n\nSimilarly, for odd rows at (2, 9), the code suggests upper neighbors as (1, 8) and (2, 8), which conflicts with the expected (2, 8) and (3, 8). This pattern suggests a consistent misalignment in neighbor identification across different row types.\n\nThe core issue seems rooted in how grid coordinates are being translated, with potential confusion around left and right neighbor definitions across alternating row configurations.\n\nI'm realizing the horizontal neighbors are straightforward - simply adjacent cells in the same row. However, vertical neighbor calculations introduce complexity based on row parity.\n\nThe grid's offset mechanism needs careful verification, potentially involving a full radius shift that impacts neighbor calculations differently for even and odd rows."

For a hex grid where:\n- Even rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are not offset\n- Odd rows (1, 3, 5, ...) are offset to the right\n\nThe neighbors should be:\n\nFor ODD rows:\n- Upper-left: contactX (same column in even row above)\n- Upper-right: contactX + 1 (one right in even row above)\n- ...\n\nFor EVEN rows:\n- Upper-left: contactX - 1 (one left in odd row above)\n- Upper-right: contactX (same column in odd row above)\n- ...\n\nSo they should be swapped!\n\nCurrently:\n- ODD rows: upper is contactX - 1, contactX\n- EVEN rows: upper is contactX, contactX + 1\n\nShould be:\n- ODD rows: upper is contactX, contactX + 1\n- EVEN rows: upper is contactX - 1, contactX\n\nLet me verify this is the issue by thinking about the geometry again.\n\n\nI'm examining the specific row configuration, focusing on how even and odd rows interact. The offset pattern creates a staggered grid where adjacent rows have different horizontal alignments. This means the neighbor calculation needs careful adjustment to account for the row-specific positioning.\n\nFor the even row at (2, 8), I've mapped out the x-coordinate positions and identified the neighboring cells in both the row above (row 7) and below (row 9). The key observation is how the x-coordinates shift between even and odd rows, creating a precise geometric relationship that determines which cells are considered neighbors.\n\nBy tracking the x-coordinate positions, I can definitively determine that for the cell (2, 8), the upper neighbors are (1, 7) and (2, 7), while the lower neighbors are (1, 9) and (2, 9). This systematic approach allows for precise neighbor identification in the staggered grid structure.\n\nThe current implementation appears to have a systematic offset error in both upper and lower neighbor calculations. For even rows, the neighbor coordinates are consistently shifted one unit incorrectly, which would lead to inaccurate neighbor selection in the grid-based algorithm.\n\nI've confirmed this pattern holds true for both odd and even rows, revealing a consistent misalignment in the neighbor calculation logic that needs correction to ensure accurate spatial relationships.\n\nThe solution involves swapping the coordinate calculations between odd and even rows, specifically adjusting the upper and lower neighbor offsets by one unit. This means for odd rows, the upper and lower left neighbors should use the current contactX value, while the right neighbors should increment by one. Conversely, for even rows, the upper and lower left neighbors should decrement by one, and the right neighbors should use the current contactX value.\n\nBy implementing these targeted adjustments, the neighbor selection algorithm will correctly map the spatial relationships across different row types in the grid system."

The `.log` extension was likely causing the IDE/tools to treat it as a binary or system log file, whereas `.md` (Markdown) is recognized as a standard text format that can be properly parsed and displayed.\n\nSo the solution was straightforward: **renaming the file from `.log` to `.md` resolved the readability issue**. Good call on that! This also makes sense semantically—you're storing console output as documentation/reference, so Markdown is actually more appropriate than a generic `.log` extension.\n\nIs there anything specific from that console output you'd like me to analyze or help debug?"

Let me search for the relevant information in the console output to understand what's happening.\n\nFrom the console log visible in the file:\n- Line 219: `[SNAP Y-SHAPE] Analyzing contact at (2,9)...`\n- Line 225: `[SNAP GEOMETRY] Neighbor (1,10) empty, distance 4.29`\n- Line 232: `[SNAP GEOMETRY] → New best: (1,10) distance 4.29`\n\nSo the contact bubble is at (2,9) (which is at column 2, row 9), and it's placing the new bubble at (1,10).\n\nThe user says they shot at the LEFT-MOST bubble. If the contact is at (2,9), that doesn't sound like the left-most. Let me think about the hex grid geometry.\n\nWait, I need to look at the actual Bubble.cs code again to see what I changed and verify if my fix was correct. Let me ask the user to show me the current state of the code, or let me check the file directly.\n\nActually, the user is showing me a screenshot or reference that the bubble is still snapping incorrectly. They say the fix hasn't worked. This means either:\n1. The fix I applied wasn't correct\n2. The fix wasn't applied properly\n3. There's another issue I missed\n\nLet me view the Bubble.cs file to see the current state of the FindBestCellForContact method."

The issue is that when the contact is at (2,9) - an odd row - it should generate neighbors:\n- (2, 8) and (3, 8) - upper\n- (1, 9) and (3, 9) - sides\n- (2, 10) and (3, 10) - lower\n\nBut the console shows (1, 10) is being selected. That's not in the list of neighbors for an odd row at (2,9). \n\nWait... (1,10) would be correct for an even row contact. Let me check the logic again.\n\nIf contactY = 9 (odd):\n- The neighbors should be offset RIGHT\n- Upper neighbors: (contactX, contactY-1) = (2, 8) and (contactX+1, contactY-1) = (3, 8)\n- Lower neighbors: (contactX, contactY+1) = (2, 10) and (contactX+1, contactY+1) = (3, 10)\n\nBut (1, 10) suggests that for row 10 (even), they're checking (contactX-1, 10), which would be right if the contact was at (2, 9) and they incorrectly applied even-row logic.\n\nHmm, wait. Let me re-read the hex grid geometry. In a hex grid with offset coordinates:\n- Odd rows are visually offset to the right\n- When looking at neighbors in adjacent rows:\n  - For an odd row cell at (x, y), its neighbors in row y+1 (even) should be at (x-1, y+1) and (x, y+1)\n  - But my code has (x, y+1) and (x+1, y+1)\n\nI think I may have gotten the neighbor offsets BACKWARD. Let me think about this more carefully...\n\nIn offset coordinates for a hex grid:\n\n\n- Odd rows shift right, creating a staggered pattern\n- Neighbors in the row below will be slightly different based on whether the current row is odd or even\n- The (1, 10) result makes sense given the offset rules for hex grids\n\nI see now that the neighbor generation depends critically on understanding how odd and even rows relate to each other spatially. The visual offset creates a unique neighbor selection pattern that's not immediately intuitive."

Now let me verify this is correct:\n\nFor an odd row contact at (2, 9):\n- isOddRow = true\n- Upper neighbors: (2-1, 9-1)=(1, 8) and (2, 9-1)=(2, 8) ✓\n- Side neighbors: (2-1, 9)=(1, 9) and (2+1, 9)=(3, 9) ✓\n- Lower neighbors: (2-1, 9+1)=(1, 10) and (2, 9+1)=(2, 10) ✓\n\nSo now it should correctly identify (1, 10) as a valid neighbor for the odd row cell at (2, 9).\n\nWait, but the console showed that (1, 10) was being selected, which was the wrong placement. So if my new code correctly identifies (1, 10) as a neighbor, won't it still select it?\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe the issue is that I need to understand which neighbor is actually the CORRECT one to snap to, not just which one is a geometric neighbor.\n\nThe real question is: when the shot bubble is at a certain world position, and it hits a contact bubble, which of the contact bubble's neighbors should it snap to?\n\nThe answer should be: the neighbor that's on the OPPOSITE side of where the shot bubble came from. If the shot bubble approached from the LEFT, it should snap to a cell on the RIGHT side of the contact bubble, not the left.\n\nSo maybe the issue isn't the neighbor offsets at all - maybe it's that the algorithm should be considering which side of the contact bubble the shot bubble is approaching from?\n\nLooking back at the user's description: \"shot at the left-most bubble and the snap is almost at the middle of the row\". This suggests the bubble is being placed too far to the right.\n\nLet me check the GetGridPosition method to understand how world coordinates map to grid positions..."
